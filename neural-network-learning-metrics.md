# Additional Metrics for Neural Network Learning Progress

1. **Confusion Matrix**: A table that describes the performance of a classification model.
   - Provides a breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications for each class.
   - Helps identify which classes are being confused with each other.

2. **Precision and Recall**:
   - Precision: The ratio of true positives to all predicted positives.
   - Recall: The ratio of true positives to all actual positives.
   - Useful for imbalanced datasets or when false positives/negatives have different costs.

3. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - Provides a single score that balances both precision and recall.

4. **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)**:
   - ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.
   - AUC provides a single score that represents the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

5. **Learning Rate**: Monitor how the learning rate changes over time, especially if using adaptive learning rate methods.

6. **Gradient Norm**: The L2 norm of the gradients.
   - Helps identify vanishing or exploding gradients.

7. **Weight Updates**: The magnitude of weight updates in each layer.
   - Helps understand if certain layers are learning faster or slower than others.

8. **Activation Statistics**: Mean and variance of activations in each layer.
   - Helps identify problems like vanishing or exploding activations.

9. **Validation Performance**: Track how the model performs on a separate validation set.
   - Helps identify overfitting if training metrics improve but validation metrics worsen.

10. **Cross-Entropy**: Measures the divergence between predicted probability distributions and true distributions.

11. **Perplexity**: Often used in language models, it's the exponential of the cross-entropy.

12. **Convergence Time**: The number of epochs or time required to reach a certain performance threshold.

13. **Kappa Statistic**: Measures agreement between predicted and actual classifications, accounting for agreement by chance.

14. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: For regression tasks or as intermediate metrics in classification.

15. **Top-k Accuracy**: For multi-class problems, checks if the correct class is among the k highest-predicted classes.

Implementation of these metrics will depend on your specific use case and the type of problem you're solving (classification, regression, etc.). Many of these can be calculated using libraries like scikit-learn in Python.
