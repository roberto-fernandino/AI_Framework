For a crypto trading neural network model, here's a recommended structure and configuration:

Inputs:
- Open, high, low, close prices for the asset over a given time period (e.g., 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day)
- Trading volume over the same time period
- Technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc. (choose 5-10 relevant indicators)
- Macroeconomic data (e.g., interest rates, inflation, GDP growth) that may impact crypto markets

Hidden Layers:
- 2-3 hidden layers with 32-64 neurons each
- Use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function for the hidden layers
- ReLU is a good default choice as it introduces nonlinearity, is computationally efficient, and helps with vanishing gradient problems

Output Layer:
- 1 neuron with a tanh activation function, producing an output between -1 and 1
- -1 represents a "sell" signal, 0 represents "hold", and 1 represents "buy"

Other Considerations:
- Normalize your input data to have zero mean and unit variance for better model performance
- Use dropout regularization (e.g., 20-30%) in the hidden layers to reduce overfitting
- Experiment with different optimization algorithms like Adam, RMSprop, or SGD
- Split your data into training, validation, and test sets to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting
- Train the model for a sufficient number of epochs, but be cautious of overfitting

This is a general structure that should work well for a crypto trading neural network model. You may need to fine-tune the hyperparameters and architecture based on your specific dataset and trading strategy. Thorough testing and validation are crucial for developing a robust and reliable trading model.
