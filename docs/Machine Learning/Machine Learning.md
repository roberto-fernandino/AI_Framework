Machine learning is what we define as a capability of a machine to learn, and improve his performance based on data she consumed. **Machine Learning** and IA are commonly addressed together, but they don't mean the same thing. Therefore every **Machine Learning** is IA not every IA is **Machine Learning**.

We have three major types of models and their typical use cases

### 1. **Supervised Learning Models**

- **Description**: These models are trained on labeled data, where each training example comes with an input-output pair. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- **Common Algorithms**:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Neural Networks (for classification and regression)
- **Use Cases**:
    - **Classification**: Predicting categorical labels, such as spam detection in emails, image classification (e.g., identifying objects in images), or medical diagnosis.
    - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values, such as predicting house prices, stock prices, or weather forecasting.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning Models**

- **Description**: These models are trained on unlabeled data, where the goal is to identify patterns or structures in the data without predefined labels.
- **Common Algorithms**:
    - K-Means Clustering
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Autoencoders (a type of neural network)
- **Use Cases**:
    - **Clustering**: Grouping similar items together, such as customer segmentation in marketing, organizing documents based on topic, or anomaly detection.
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information, useful for data visualization, noise reduction, or preprocessing before applying another algorithm.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning Models**

- **Description**: These models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and optimizing their actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
- **Common Algorithms**:
    - Q-Learning
    - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    - Policy Gradient Methods
- **Use Cases**:
    - **Robotics**: Training robots to perform tasks like walking, grasping objects, or navigating.
    - **Game AI**: Developing agents that can play games like chess, Go, or video games at a superhuman level.
    - **Recommendation Systems**: Optimizing recommendations based on user interactions over time, such as personalized content delivery or ad placement.

These three model types cover a wide range of machine learning tasks and are foundational to building intelligent systems in various domains.
